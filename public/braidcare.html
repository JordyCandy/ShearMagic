        <p>After having your hair braided, it's essential to take proper care of your braids to ensure they stay looking good and to maintain the health of your hair and scalp</p>
        <p>Here are a few tips to keep your braids looking good longer:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mid-section1">
            <div class="mid1 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Keep your braids clean&#10024;</h3>
                <p>Dilute sulfate-free shampoo with water in a spray bottle and apply it to your scalp. Massage it in, and then rinse with lukewarm water.
                     Avoid scrubbing vigorously to prevent frizz.</p>
                 <p>Consider using a dry shampoo or a scalp cleansing spray between washes to keep your scalp fresh.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid2 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Hydrate your scalp&#10024;</h3>
                <p>
                    Apply a lightweight, oil-free scalp moisturizer to keep your scalp from becoming dry and itchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Avoid heavy oils and products that can build up on your scalp, as this can lead to product residue and flakiness.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid3 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Protect your braids at night&#10024;</h3>
                <p>Keep your braids covered or wrapped while you sleep, preferably in a satin or silk bonnet/scarf to prevent frizz and breakage</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid4 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Avoid excessive pulling and tugging&#10024;</h3>
                <p>
                    Be gentle when styling and tying your braids. Excessive tension can lead to hair breakage and stress on your scalp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use hair accessories like scrunchies or hairpins that won't snag or pull on your braids.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid5 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Moisturize your hair&#10024;</h3>
                <p>
                    Apply a lightweight hair oil to the length of your braids to keep them from becoming too dry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Avoid products with heavy ingredients like silicone, which can cause buildup.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid6 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Minimize heat styling&#10024;</h3>
                <p>
                    Try to avoid using heat styling tools, as the heat can weaken and damage your braids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you must use heat, use a heat protectant and keep the temperature low.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid7 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Touch up your edges&#10024;</h3>
                <p>
                    If your edges start to look frizzy, you can use a bit of edge control or a water and gel mixture to smooth them down.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid8 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Avoid excessive moisture&#10024;</h3>
                <p>
                    Too much water can weaken your braids and lead to frizz and unraveling. Protect your braids from excessive moisture, especially when swimming or in humid environments.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid9 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Regular maintenance&#10024;</h3>
                <p>
                    Depending on your hair type and the style, you may need to get your braids redone or tightened after a few weeks to maintain their appearance and protect your natural hair.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mid10 l">
                <h3>&#10024;Listen to your hair and scalp&#10024;</h3>
                <p>
                    Pay attention to any discomfort, itching, or unusual changes in your scalp. If you experience any issues, consult a professional or remove your braids.
